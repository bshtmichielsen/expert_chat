{"prompt":"Describe the basic objective of most modern board games.","completion":"Most modern board games ask players to achieve a clear victory condition such as reaching a target score, completing a set of objectives, being the last player remaining, or fulfilling a thematic goal (e.g., building a settlement, completing routes, or defeating opponents). Gameplay typically alternates turns, and players use strategy, resource management, luck, or negotiation to progress toward that objective."}

Examples include Settlers of Catan (resource trading and building), Ticket to Ride (route-building with simple rules), and Carcassonne (tile placement with easy scoring and expanding strategy)."}
{"prompt":"What are common mechanics found in board games?","completion":"Common mechanics include worker placement, deck-building, tile placement, area control, set collection, hand management, dice rolling, auction/bidding, drafting, and cooperative play. Many games combine several mechanics to create unique interactions and strategic choices."}
{"prompt":"How does board game worker placement function?","completion":"In worker placement games, players place one or more 'worker' tokens on action spaces to take actions or claim resources. Once an action is taken by a worker, that action is usually unavailable to other players until the next round, forcing players to prioritize moves and plan around competition for limited spots."}
{"prompt":"Describe the concept of deck-building in board games and name a popular deck-builder.","completion":"Deck-building is a mechanic where players progressively construct a personal deck of cards during the game, buying or acquiring cards that improve their options on future turns.

Simpler rules broaden accessibility and make games suitable for families or new players. The key is matching complexity to the intended audience and clearly teaching rules."}
{"prompt":"Explain the importance of player count balancing in board games.","completion":"Games can play differently with varying player counts; designers often include scaling rules or components to maintain balance and pacing. Proper balancing ensures game length, competition intensity, and strategic options remain engaging whether two players or more are present."}
{"prompt":"What makes a good solo mode for a board game?","completion":"A good solo mode simulates opponents or time pressure with an AI deck, automated actions, or scenario rules that provide meaningful decisions and adjustable difficulty. It should preserve core mechanics while offering challenge and replayability without depending on multiplayer negotiation or diplomacy."}
{"prompt":"How do expansions typically change a base game?","completion":"Expansions add components, rules, scenarios, or modular systems that increase depth, variety, or player count. They can introduce new mechanics or tweak balance, offering fresh choices and replayability while relying on the base game for core components."}
{"prompt":"Give advice for teaching a new board game to beginners.","completion":"Start by explaining the victory condition and turn structure, demonstrate one full round, teach only essential rules first, and answer questions as they arise. Use examples and highlight player choices rather than reading every rule; let a practice round show interactions before adding advanced rules."}
{"prompt":"Recommend three board games for casual groups and explain why.","completion":"Ticket to Ride — simple rules, fast setup, and engaging route competition; Catan — social trading and approachable resource strategy good for group interaction; Carcassonne — quick turns, tile placement that scales well with casual players and is easy to teach."}
